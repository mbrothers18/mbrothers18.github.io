		<h1>WxFL Overview</h1>

		<!--Quick Overview of League-->
		<h3>League Overview</h3>
		<p>WxFL is a fantasy weather league where teams of six CONUS cities (three starters and three bench) will compete against other teams in various meteorological phenomena occurring at their cities over the course of three seasons (Winter, Spring, and Summer). Teams will be ranked against opposing teams in each of these categories for each month as well as their season total for select categories. Points will be awarded (between 0 and 1) based on how close a team is to the leader in each category. The team with the most points (monthly and season) at the end of the season (Winter, Spring, and Summer) will be deemed the winner. The top three teams each season will earn the right to participate in WxFL's postseason, The Gauntlet Playoffs. For further details on the league's rules, see <a href="./Rules.htm">Rulebook</a>.</p>
